## About this Site
This website is part of my personal interest to build better tools for lawyers and those who deal with the law. For my day job, I am the General Counsel to the Council of the District of Columbia. It's an amazing position. I have a top-notch staff and the work is deeply fascinating. This website is not, however, an official site and nothing in the site should be construed as either (1) legal advice or solicitation, or (2) an endorsement by the Council of any of the views, data, or information shared on this site.
